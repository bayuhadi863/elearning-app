## About Smanda iLearn

Smanda iLearn is a web-based Learning Management System application. This
application was created as part of my final project for the Web-Based
Application Workshop course at the Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya. The
purpose of this application is to manage (upload, view, download, and perform
CRUD operations on) learning materials, assignments, quizzes, and grades. For
this project, the target is set for SMAN 1 Pandaan, Pasuruan, which is the high
school I attended. Nevertheless, this application can be used for high schools,
junior high schools, or elementary schools anywhere.
